    <p>
        I’m Eren Sönmez, a third-year Computer Engineering student. My fascination with technology dates back to my childhood.
        During my high school years, I had the opportunity to work extensively with Arduino, which allowed me to dive deeper into the
        world of hardware and embedded systems. This hands-on experience ignited my interest in computer engineering and
        motivated me to pursue it as my academic path.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm deeply enthusiastic about project development and thrive in collaborative environments. As a Computer Engineering
        student, I've gained a solid foundation in various programming languages and problem-solving techniques, which I'm eager to
        apply to real-world challenges. I believe in the power of teamwork to drive innovation, and I'm committed to contributing my
        skills and knowledge to meaningful projects in the field of technology.
